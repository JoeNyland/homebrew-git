# homebrew-git

A collection of Git utilities that I've created, installable via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install masterroot24/git/<formula>`

Or `brew tap masterroot24/git` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Troubleshooting
Please check the main [Homebrew troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md) and then [open an issue in this tap](https://github.com/MasterRoot24/homebrew-git/issues/new).
